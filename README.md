# Introduction to machine learning 
Homework assignments:
- Linear regression (predicting the cost of an appartment in Boston)
- Perceptron bsed classifier (MNIST)
- Neural Networks (Vanilla Python & Pytorch implementation)
- GAN and vae, cat images generation
- SVM (linear and polinomial kernnel) 
- Decision Trees 
- Random forest (decision trees based implementation & Catboost)
- Naive Bayes (spam & ham classification, using Bow and stemming) 
- Stochastic Stranding (using Hill Climb and Genetic algorithm for optimizing the route for runners)
